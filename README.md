This repository serves as a ML Portfolio alongside my tasks for my internship at TechnoHacks EduTech.

The Cifar10 dataset comprises of 10000 images of various color to no color pixels ranging from an 8 bit range of 0-255. It is an exceptional dataset to aply my CNN model on which is best fit for image classification
